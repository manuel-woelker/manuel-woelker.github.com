I have decided that it is time to get back to blogging after my two-year hiatus. [My old blog](http://eclipsesource.com/blogs/author/manuel/) still has all the old content, but this blog will host all the new stuff I got cooking.

Topics I plan on writing about are my thoughts on software development, my ongoing github projects, and technical issues from my day job. I hope the upcoming holidays will give me a chance to get some projects underway.
